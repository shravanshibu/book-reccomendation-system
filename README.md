RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS

Popularity-Based Recommendation System
 
It is a type of recommendation system which works on the principle of popularity and or anything which is in trend. These systems check about the product or movie which are in trend or are most popular among the users and directly recommend those.
 
For example, if a product is often purchased by most people then the system will get to know that that product is the most popular so for every new user who just signed it, the system will recommend that product to that user also and chances becomes high that the new user will also purchase that.
 
Content-Based Recommendation System
It is another type of recommendation system which works on the principle of similar content. If a user is watching a movie, then the system will check about other movies of similar content or the same genre of the movie the user is watching. There are various fundamentals attributes that are used to compute the similarity while checking about similar content.
